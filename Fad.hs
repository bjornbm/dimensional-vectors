-- Forward Automatic Differentiation via overloading to perform
-- nonstandard interpretation that replaces original numeric type with
-- corresponding dual number type.

-- Credits:

--  Authors:
--     Barak A. Pearlmutter <barak@cs.nuim.ie> & 
--     Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@purdue.edu>

--  Work started as stripped-down version of higher-order tower code
--  published by Jerzy Karczmarczuk <jerzy.karczmarczuk@info.unicaen.fr>
--  which used a non-standard standard prelude.

--  Initial perturbation-confusing code is a modified version of
--  http://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/some-playing-with-derivatives/

--  Tag trick, called "branding" in the Haskell community, from
--  Bj\"orn Buckwalter <bjorn.buckwalter@gmail.com>
--  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/22308/

-- To Do:

-- Extend to an infinite tower of derivatives (power series) rather
-- than just the first derivative.  Perhaps this could use the
-- existing power series module.

-- Add some more optimization routines, and some examples.

-- Notes:

-- Each invocation of the differentiation function introduces a
-- distinct perturbation, which requires a distinct dual number type.
-- In order to prevent these from being confused, tagging, called
-- branding in the Haskell community, is used.  This seems to prevent
-- perturbation confusion, although it would be nice to have an actual
-- proof of this.  The technique does require adding invocations of
-- lift at appropriate places when nesting is present.

-- The "pass in a lifter" approach, discussed in the HOSC paper, was
-- rediscovered and implemented by David Roundy <droundy@darcs.net>
-- http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/22308
-- Unfortunately this would preclude writing in a natural style, and
-- is therefore not used here.  It however could be combined with
-- tagging to allow dynamic nesting, if the type system would allow.

-- The constructor is "Bundle" because dual numbers are tangent-vector
-- bundles, in the terminology of differential geometry.  For the same
-- reason, the accessor is "tangent".

-- The multivariate case is handled as a list on inputs, but an
-- arbitrary functor on outputs.  This asymmetry is because Haskell
-- provides fmap but not fzipWith.

-- Some care has been taken to ensure that correct interoperation with
-- complex numbers.  Particular care must be taken with the
-- non-analytic functions, namely abs and signum.  These are not
-- properly differentiable over the complex domain, but they do admit
-- directional derivatives (push-forwards) where both the primal and
-- tangents are complex.  Unfortunately the Haskell numeric system is
-- modularized in a fashion that appears to make this impossible to
-- express.  Instead, we detect the situation and handle it
-- appropriately.

-- Digression: the reason for this difficulty.

-- The relationship of interest, valid for both real and complex
-- valued x, is:

--   x = (abs x) * (signum x)

-- This gives rise to division in the formulas for abs and signum when
-- x is complex.  For real x, (signum x) = 1/(signum x), so the
-- division can be replaced by multiplication.  But not in the complex
-- case.  And unfortunately, abs & signum are defined for Num, which
-- does not have division.

-- The "right" solution would be to have signumRecip defined for Num,
-- where (signumRecip x) * (signum x) = 1.  This would allow things to
-- be defined so as to be correct in the case of complex numbers
-- without using division, and would be trivial in the real case where
-- signum x = signumRecip x.  Moreover (magnitude (signum z)) == 1, so
-- we could use signumRecip = conjugate . signum for complex numbers.
-- Except that conjugate is defined only for complex numbers, which is
-- strange since it would just be the identity for real numbers.

-- Another problem supporting complex numbers!  This is a show stopper
-- for doing transparent forward AD on functions that are explicitly

-- The following will not work:

-- instance Complex a => Complex (Dual a) where
--     realPart  (Bundle x x') = Bundle (realPart x)  (realPart x')
--     imagPart  (Bundle x x') = Bundle (imagPart x)  (imagPart x')
--     conjugate (Bundle x x') = Bundle (conjugate x) (conjugate x')
--     ...

-- This fails because Complex is not sufficiently abstract.  It is
-- impossible to make (Dual (Complex a)) a complex number; the system
-- can only do (Complex (Dual a)).  This makes it impossible to take
-- derivatives of complex functions using the same API as non-complex
-- functions.

-- This is mainly to get atan2 to work, which is by inheritance.

-- Note that atan2 is important in numeric code: to a first

-- instead.  In particular it is virtually impossible for "atan (y/x)"
-- to be correct; "atan2 y x" is almost certainly what is really meant.

{-

 Warning!  If we do not give a special definition of atan2 below,
 instead allowing it to default, there are errors at branch points, in
 particular at (atan2 1 0).  These occur with "probability zero"
 around the unit circule, so you might not notice them with random
 testing.
